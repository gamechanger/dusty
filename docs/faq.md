# Frequently Asked Questions

### I'm having trouble running Docker commands on my Mac - what gives??

If you're seeing something like:
```
$ docker ps
FATA[0000] Get http:///var/run/docker.sock/v1.18/containers/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: no such file or directory. Are you trying to connect to a TLS-enabled daemon without TLS?
```

You probably just need to run `eval $(docker-machine env dusty)`

### How can Dusty access my private GitHub repos?

The Dusty daemon, which runs as root, manages your GitHub repos by default.
To get permissions to clone from GitHub, the
Daemon will make use of your unprivileged user's SSH_AUTH_SOCK. This means that the daemon's
behavior using git should be the same as your user's, in terms of SSH authentication.

If you want Dusty to be
able to clone your private GitHub repos, you need to configure your standard user (whoever
your `mac_username` is set to), to be able to clone repositories without any prompt for
confirmation or password.

```
ssh-add -K <path-of-private-key>
```
ssh-add adds private key identities to the authentication agent, ssh-agent. This will allow Dusty
to pull repos using your `mac_username`'s ssh credentials.

If you arent using default SSH agent but instead use something like `gnupg` as SSH agent
you might need to adjust `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`:

```
$ launchctl asuser $(id -u) launchctl setenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
```

### My tests are hanging at this step: `Creating test...`.  What do I do?
Dusty tests use docker logs, which streams one line at a time.  So if you are using a test library which outputs its results on a single line (like python's nosetests) this can give the illusion that your tests are hanging when they running fine.

### Why doesn't Dusty support Linux?

Dusty might be ported to Linux in the future, although we don't have concrete plans to
do so. Many of the problems Dusty solves are specific to an OSX environment, where
Docker can't run natively.

### I've read the Dusty docs, but I'd like more information!

We have a public Slack org where you can hang out with the Dusty core contributors
and other users. You can [register here](https://dusty-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

### Why is it called Dusty?

Dusty is named after [Dusty Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Baker),
baseball manager and co-inventor of the [high five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_five).
